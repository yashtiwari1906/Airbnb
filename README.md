# Airbnb_Dataset

In this post, we are going to explore and visualize a really interesting dataset. That is the London Airbnb listings dataset. The data was scraped from the Airbnb site and is publicly available at Inside Airbnb. This dataset contains "publicly available information about a city's Airbnb's listings, Inside Airbnb provides filters and key metrics so you can see how Airbnb is being used to compete with the residential housing market".

We are going to analyze it with different aspects of this data set but our main aim will be to determine the price and customer behaviour on the fundamentals provided by Airbnb
